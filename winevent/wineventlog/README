This code started its life as a direct lift of the code at https://github.com/elastic/beats/tree/master/winlogbeat/sys/wineventlog
which is governed by the Apache2.0 license.  We had to lift the code due to the vendoring that the elastic respository enforces.

But now it's so heavily modified it's basically its own beast, but still governed under the Apache2.0 license.

Abandon hope all ye who enter here, the Windows eventlog system is a patchwork of hellfire, brimestone, UTF-16, and XML.
