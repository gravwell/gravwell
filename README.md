Gravwell data generators

This respository is a collection of data generators used to test Gravwell ingest and search.

Most generators have a corresponding .ax (auto extractor) and .ext (indexing extractor) file.

The generators use a library that generates random values that are mostly non-sensical, but useful in testing indexing, query, and storage performance.
